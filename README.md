# SportsStore
I am starting to get familiar with all the moving part, I still find debugging difficult because there are just so many components. 
I have a question about chapter. Under listing 9-5, it reads: "Adding a New Attribute in the List.cshtml File in the Views/Home Folder", but the instructions of chapter state that List.cshtml should be placed inside product folder. I am supposed to move the file to a different location? because i kept it inside the product folder. This caused multiple hours and even had to create a new branch to start over.
