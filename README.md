I am starting to get familiar with all the moving part, I still find debugging difficult because there are just so many components. 

On chapter 11, we need to download 3 javascript libraries. I couldn't find "jquery-validation": "1.17.0". It is just not available. I ended up using "jQuery-Validation-Engine@2.6.4" because it seemd to be the most similar and also because a discussion board advise. Is this the correct replacement? What is the difference between the 2 libraries?
